- Update CMC state machine to request array-list on a regular basis, to handle whether or not the currently known arrays are still active, or if there are new ones.
- Handle the skarab serial numbers in the html representation, and which meerkat antennas are assigned to which fhosts.
- Maybe a timestamp on the HTML representation.
